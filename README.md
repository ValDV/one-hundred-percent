## Why Do This?

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to push your computer's processor and memory to their limits ?
This tutorial is for you! I wanted to create a super simple script that doesn't need any extensions or extra resources to max out the CPU and memory stats on my computer.
Here's a short and easy PowerShell script that does just that and will satisfy your curiosity.

## Warning

Although this script is simple and normally safe, it can cause the machine it's running on to overheat, lag, crash, or even get damaged in the worst case.
So, I advise you not to run it for too long. Use it wisely !

## Guide

### How to Set It Up?

1. Open a PowerShell window as an administrator.
2. Copy the code from the text file.
3. Paste it into the PowerShell window.
4. Open the Task Manager to admit the result. ðŸ˜‰

You can adjust the parameters `$cpuProcessCount` and `$memoryProcessCount` according to your machine's performance.
In some cases, the script may not push the statistics to 100%, so feel free to run the script multiple times.
